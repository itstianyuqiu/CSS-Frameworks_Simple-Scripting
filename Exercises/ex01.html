Join one of the fastest growing industries in the world

Technology is one of New Zealand’s fastest growing industries, and our third largest export earner. As a
result there’s a huge demand for ICT graduates who can hit the ground running. That’s where the Auckland ICT
Graduate School comes in. In a collaboration between the University of Auckland and the University of
Waikato, we’ve created two postgraduate programmes to develop smart, industry-ready ICT graduates who will
meet this need.

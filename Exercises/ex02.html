        About Us

        The Auckland ICT Graduate School is a joint initiative by the University of Auckland and the University
        of Waikato, established to meet the increasing demand for industry-ready ICT graduates. You’ll be taught
        at either our Auckland campus or our Hamilton campus, and at the premises of our industry partners. Your
        degree will be awarded by the university where you choose to study.

        As well as connecting universities, we’re also forging a strong partnership between New Zealand’s
        tertiary and business sectors. We have long established links with some of New Zealand’s largest and
        most renowned companies.

        Postgraduate Certificate in Information Technology

        Kick-start your ICT career

        Designed for students with a non ICT-related bachelors degree, our Postgraduate Certificate in
        Information Technology (PGCertInfoTech) will teach you the specialist skills you need to ignite your
        career in ICT.

        It’s difficult to think of a business area that doesn’t rely on ICT, and ICT capability is integral to
        business success. ICT is the fastest growing industry in New Zealand, and businesses demand employees
        who have the skills to help drive this growth.

        If you’ve ever considered working in the ICT sector, the PGCertInfoTech is the programme for you. The
        short,
        intensive programme is ideal for those who already have an undergraduate degree in a non ICT-related
        subject, and offers a supercharged route into the industry.

        You’ll gain fundamental skills in software development, including up-to-date knowledge of object-oriented
        programming and design, web technologies and databases, which will complement your existing critical
        thinking and communication abilities.
